#Optimizing Resource Allocation in Healthcare During the COVID-19 Pandemic from 2020 to 2023 

#Introduction

Health services incorporate all the treatments implemented to enhance health and prevent illness, ranging from medical treatment, drugs, biotechnology, and health insurance. It comprises hospitals, clinics, laboratories, and other related structures that have emerged due to technological developments in the healthcare sector, demographic pressure, and a growing consciousness concerning health in the global society.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, many challenges were faced by the healthcare industry, especially to allocate resources within the healthcare sector. Accurately allocating resources such as testing kits, medical personnel, and hospital beds was crucial to mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Here I will do descriptive and predictive analytics to identify the pattern of testing demand and predict future cases.
